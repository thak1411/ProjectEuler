# Even Fibonacci numbers
   
# Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

1, 2로 시작하는 피보나치 수열에서 400만을 넘기지 않는 짝수값들의 합을 구하시오

result : 4613732
